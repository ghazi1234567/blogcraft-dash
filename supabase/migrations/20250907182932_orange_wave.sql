        <p>TypeScript has revolutionized the way we write JavaScript, providing type safety and better developer experience. In this comprehensive guide, we''ll explore advanced TypeScript techniques that will take your coding skills to the next level.</p>
        
        <h2>Generic Types and Constraints</h2>
        <p>Generics are one of TypeScript''s most powerful features, allowing you to write reusable code that works with multiple types while maintaining type safety.</p>
        
        <h2>Conditional Types</h2>
        <p>Conditional types enable you to create types that depend on a condition, making your type definitions more flexible and expressive.</p>
        
        <h2>Mapped Types</h2>
        <p>Mapped types allow you to create new types by transforming properties of existing types, providing powerful ways to manipulate type definitions.</p>
        
        <h2>Template Literal Types</h2>
        <p>Template literal types combine the power of template literals with TypeScript''s type system, enabling sophisticated string manipulation at the type level.</p>
        
        <h2>Utility Types</h2>
        <p>TypeScript provides many built-in utility types that help you transform and manipulate types in common ways, making your code more concise and readable.</p>
